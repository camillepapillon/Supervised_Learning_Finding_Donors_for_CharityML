# Supervised Learning project for Udacity : Intro to Machine learning with Tensorflow 

This project was done as part of the Udacity Nanodegree : Introduction to Machine Learning with Tensorflow Nanodegree during the module on supervised machine learning.

The goal for this project is to employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The best candidate algorithm is then chosen from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. 

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid". You can find the article by Ron Kohavi online. The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the 'fnlwgt' feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.
